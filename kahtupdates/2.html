                    <li><strong>Boot into Safe Mode</strong>
                        <p>Restart your computer and boot into Safe Mode. Safe Mode loads the minimum system files and drivers, which helps prevent the virus from running during startup.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Run Antivirus Software</strong>
                        <p>Use antivirus software to perform a full scan and remove the virus. If you don't have antivirus software, you can download and install one from a trusted source in Safe Mode.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Delete Suspect Files</strong>
                        <p>Check for suspicious files and programs in your system and delete them. Pay special attention to unknown sources or suspicious executable files.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Update the System and Software</strong>
                        <p>Ensure that your operating system and all software are updated to the latest version to patch any existing security vulnerabilities.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Restore the System</strong>
                        <p>If the problem is severe, consider using the system restore feature to restore to an earlier system restore point or reinstall the operating system.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Backup Important Data</strong>
                        <p>After resolving the issue, ensure to back up all important data to prevent data loss in the future.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>By following these steps, you can effectively resolve the issue of your computer being infected with a virus. If the problem persists, it is recommended to seek professional technical support.</p>

                <h2 id="three"># How to Identify Virus Files</h2>
                <p>Identifying virus files is an important step in protecting your computer's security. Here are some common methods to identify virus files:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Check File Name and Path</strong>
                        <p>Virus files often use the names of normal files or system files to disguise themselves, such as changing svchost.exe to svch0st.exe, or appearing in folders that they shouldn't be in, such as the windows folder where you find files like RAV or RealPlayer.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Check File Properties</strong>
                        <p>Check the file's version information and manufacturer information. Normal files usually have detailed version information and manufacturer information, while virus files may not have version information, or the manufacturer information may not match the file name, such as a strange file name but Microsoft's manufacturer information.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Scan with Antivirus Software</strong>
                        <p>Use antivirus software to scan suspicious files. Antivirus software will use its virus database, including feature codes, behavior patterns, etc., to determine whether a file is a virus.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Analyze File Behavior</strong>
                        <p>Run suspicious files in a sandbox environment and observe their behavior. Virus files usually perform some abnormal operations, such as frequently accessing the registry, modifying system files, downloading other malicious files, etc.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Check File MD5 Value</strong>
                        <p>Calculate the MD5 value of the file and compare it with the MD5 values in the virus database. If a match is found, it indicates that the file is a malicious file.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Check the API Called by the File</strong>
                        <p>Use disassembly tools to view the API called by the file. Virus files may call some APIs that are unrelated to normal programs, such as frequently calling CreateFile, WriteFile, etc. file operation APIs.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
